This vscode extension integrates with GitHub.

## Features

Current it is possible to do the following:

* Checkout one of the open pull requests
* Browse one of the open pull requests in your default browser
* Display pull request and current status (e.g. mergeable, travis build done, ...) in the StatusBar
* Create a new pull request based on the current branch and the last commit
  The current branch will be requested to merge into master and the pull request title is the commit message summary, or a custom message if configured that way.
* Merge current pull request with either of 'merge', 'squash' or 'rebase' method.
* Configure default branch, merge method and refresh interval.

## Setup Personal Access Token

To use this extension one needs to create a new GitHub Personal Access Token and registers it in the extension.
The 'GitHub: Set Personal Access Token' should be executed for that.
